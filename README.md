This project focuses on analyzing Walmart's sales data to gain insights into the performance of top branches and products, identify sales trends across various categories, and understand customer behavior. The goal is to evaluate and optimize sales strategies for improved efficiency and effectivenes.

This project focuses on forecasting sales for 45 Walmart stores located across different regions, each consisting of multiple departments. Using historical sales data, the objective is to predict the sales for each department in each store. The dataset also includes selected holiday markdown events, which influence sales patterns. Understanding which departments are affected and the extent of this impact adds complexity to the analysis.
